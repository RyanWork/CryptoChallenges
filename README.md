CryptoChallenges Project
======
The following project is just a simple side project highlighting the small set of challenges
provided by [Cryptopals Crypto Challenges](https://cryptopals.com/). Give them a chance! They
are a good introduction to the world of cryptography.

The implementation of these challenges were done in C#.

In the current project you will find:
+ The project that provides all of the methods found to solve the problems
+ Test cases that will test the methods and apply the challenge's parameters
